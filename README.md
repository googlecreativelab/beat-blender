# Beat Blender
### Blend beats using machine learning to create music in a fun new way. [g.co/beatblender](https://g.co/beatblender)

Built using [deeplearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org) and [MusicVAE.js](https://goo.gl/magenta/musicvae-js).

## Usage

Beat Blender requires the [GCloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads) for running the server and [node + npm](http://nodejs.org) for javascript development.


1. Run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies of this project.
2. Run `npm start` to begin all file-watchers and to initialize the server on port `8080`
3. Open `http://localhost:8080`


## Easter eggs
You have added a few query-strings that you can play with, you can load a different model for MusicVAE using `checkpoint=url` or a custom model for generating new beats with `samplerCheckpoint=url`
